1.Find an effect you want to put the behaviourid on (use memory viewer for effect, then put it in effect helper)
2.Change the Cycle occurence to 3650 aka dragon body buff (an effect that also has a bullet there are multiple, this is the best one however)
3. Set motioninterval to 1 or -1 (to fire 1, if you want more, set the motion interval lower)
4.Record effect again, but this time look for the dragon body buff
5.Open the dragon body buff in effect helper
6.Find BehaviourID (it should be 100010)
7. Change BehaviourID to any value on the spreadsheet and your original effect will now shoot that
8.If you want to fire a BehaviourID infinitely, set the Cycleoccurence on 3650 to 3650.
WARNING I DO NOT RECCOMEND STEP 8 AS IT WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY YOUR POOR FPS ON SOME EFFECT.
